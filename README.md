# Predicting Premier League games outcome based onMachine Learning
Abstractâ€”
In this paper, we present different machine-learningtechniques  to  try  to  predict  outcomes  of  the  English  Premierleague  football  games  using  past  in-game  statistics  and  teamrankings.  After  working  on  the  data  bases,  we  applied  fourmachine learning techniques and compared their accuracy. Ourbenchmark  to  test  our  results  is  to  compare  the  predictions  ofour models with the predictions from the market odds. The lastsection of the paper explores a simple betting strategy based onour predictions to have a global idea if our models could be usedto  make  profits.
